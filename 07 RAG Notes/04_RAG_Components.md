# 📚 Core Components of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

## 🌟 Quick Idea

* A **normal LLM** just answers from what it already knows.
* In **RAG**, the LLM is connected to a **vector database**.
* The database gives the LLM **extra info (context)** → so the answer is more accurate and up-to-date.

---

## 🏗️ RAG Pipeline = 3 Main Parts

1. **Document Ingestion & Pre-processing** → Get company data (PDFs, CSVs, websites…) → clean, split, and store it.
2. **Query Processing** → User asks a question → system searches the vector DB → finds matching chunks.
3. **Generation** → LLM uses those chunks as context → writes the final answer.

---

## 🔎 Phase 1: Document Ingestion & Pre-processing

**Goal:** Put company data into the vector database so LLM can use it later.

### 🔹 Steps:

1. **Collect data**

   * PDFs, Word docs, CSVs, websites, databases, etc.

2. **Split into chunks**

   * Big docs → cut into small pieces (chunks).
   * ❓ Why? → LLMs can only handle a limited **context size** (like memory).

     * Example: Some LLMs can “remember” 500 pages, others only 100. Splitting avoids overload.

3. **Convert text into vectors**

   * Use an **embedding model** (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face).
   * Converts sentences → numbers (vectors).
   * Example: “AI is cool” → `[0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.1, 0.7]`.

4. **Store in vector DB**

   * Examples: **Pinecone, ChromaDB, Weaviate, DataStax**.
   * Now all chunks are searchable using similarity.

---

## 🧮 How Search Works in Vector DB

When a user asks a question →

* Convert the question to a vector too.
* Compare with stored vectors using **similarity measures**:

  * ✅ Cosine similarity
  * ✅ Euclidean distance
* Closest match = most relevant chunk → sent to the LLM as context.

Example:

* Question: *“What is an LLM?”*
* System finds the chunk in the PDF that explains LLM → sends it to the LLM → LLM summarizes → gives final answer.

## 🧠 Memory Hook

Think of **RAG like a student in an open-book exam**:

* **Ingestion = building the library** (put notes/books into DB).
* **Query processing = finding the right page** in the book.
* **Generation = writing the answer** using that page + student’s own knowledge.

---

## ✅ Recap (Phase 1)

* Get data → split → embed → store in DB.
* Splitting helps fit into LLM memory (context limit).
* Embeddings = text turned into numbers so machine can compare meanings.
* Vector DB makes searching fast and accurate.

---

👉 Next step: **Query Processing Phase** = how the LLM asks the DB and retrieves context.

# 🔍 Query Processing Phase (Step 2 of RAG)

## 📌 Recap

* In **Step 1 (Document Ingestion)**, we:

  * Collected data (PDFs, Docs, Websites…)
  * Split into chunks
  * Converted chunks → vectors (using embedding models)
  * Stored them in a **Vector Database**

Now → Database is ready ✅

---

## 🏗️ Step 2: Query Processing

### 1️⃣ User Input (Query)

* Example: **“What is RAG?”**

### 2️⃣ Convert Query → Vector

* Use the **same embedding model** used in ingestion.
* Turns query into a vector (numbers like `[0.3, 0.4, 0.6 …]`).

### 3️⃣ Search the Vector Database

* Compare **query vector** with stored vectors (from chunks).
* Use similarity techniques:

  * **Cosine similarity**
  * **Euclidean distance**
* Find the **most relevant chunks** (closest matches).

### 4️⃣ Retrieve Chunks

* Example: Get **Doc1, Doc2, Doc3** that are most relevant.
* These retrieved pieces = **retrieved results** ✅

### 5️⃣ Enrich Context

* Add **metadata** (like source, tags, page number).
* This makes context **more accurate and trustworthy**.

---

## 🧠 Easy Analogy

Think of this like **searching in a school library**:

* **Query = your question** (“What is RAG?”)
* **Embedding = turning question into a “search code”**
* **Vector DB = library index** (all books split into pages & stored as numbers)
* **Similarity search = librarian finding the right pages**
* **Retrieved chunks = pages you get**

---

# 📝 Generation Phase (Step 3 of RAG)

### How It Works:

1. Take:

   * **Original Query** (e.g., “What is RAG?”)
   * **Retrieved Chunks** (relevant passages)
   * **Enriched Context** (extra metadata)

2. Send them together → **LLM** (like OpenAI GPT, LLaMA, Gemini, Groq, etc.).

3. LLM uses this context to:

   * Summarize
   * Explain clearly in **human-like language**

### Final Output:

* User gets a **summarized, accurate answer** (sounds conversational, just like talking to a person).

## ✅ Complete RAG Pipeline Recap

1. **Document Ingestion** → Collect, Split, Embed, Store in Vector DB.
2. **Query Processing** → Convert query → Vector → Search → Retrieve chunks.
3. **Generation** → Send query + chunks to LLM → Get final summarized answer.

---

## 🧠 Memory Hook

Think of **RAG = Open-book test**:

* Step 1 → **Prepare the book** (ingestion).
* Step 2 → **Find the right page** (query processing).
* Step 3 → **Write the answer in your own words** (generation).
