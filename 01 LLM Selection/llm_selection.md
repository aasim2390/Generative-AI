üß† LLM Choice Rule: "Rank, Probe, Compare."

Rank ‚Äì Start with the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard to see who‚Äôs leading in real-world conversations.

Probe ‚Äì Throw bold, tricky prompts at contenders to reveal bias, filtering, and true depth.

Compare ‚Äì Line up the same prompt across models for side-by-side clarity.

üí° Top scores mean nothing if the answers don‚Äôt fit your values and tasks.

How to Pick the Best Brain for Your AI Agent
Think of an LLM as the ‚Äúbrain‚Äù of your agent. To choose the best one:

Know the job ‚Äì What do you want your agent to do? (Answer questions fast? Do deep research? Handle tools like APIs?)

Decide what matters most ‚Äì Pick from these 7 things:

Think ‚Äì Can it solve tricky problems?

Call ‚Äì Can it use tools or talk to other apps?

Hit ‚Äì Does it give correct answers?

Save ‚Äì Is it cheap enough to run often?

Hold ‚Äì Can it remember lots of info at once?

Shape ‚Äì Can it give neat, organized answers like JSON?

Ship ‚Äì Is it easy to connect and fast to reply?

Pick a few to test ‚Äì Try your hardest task on each one.

Compare results ‚Äì See which is fastest, most accurate, and fits your budget.

Choose the winner ‚Äì Pick the one that handles your job best without breaking the bank.
