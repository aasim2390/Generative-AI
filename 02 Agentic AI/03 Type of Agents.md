# 1. Simple Reflex Agents

## What Are They?
Simple reflex agents are the most basic type of AI agents.  
They react to specific situations in their environment using simple rules.

---

## How Do They Work?
- These agents use **"if-then"** rules to decide what to do based on the current input from their sensors.  
- They **don’t remember past actions** or learn from experiences.

**Example: Temperature Control System**
- **Rule:** *"If the room temperature goes over 45°C, then turn on the air conditioning."*  
- The agent measures the temperature and, if it’s too hot, activates the AC.

---

## Characteristics
- **No Memory:** They do not keep track of past events or decisions.  
- **Straightforward Design:** They depend on clear rules to dictate their actions.

---

## Where Are They Used?
**Common Applications:**
- Adjusting room temperature with a thermostat.
- Performing simple actions like resetting passwords based on keywords.
- Control systems in simple robots (e.g., vacuum cleaners responding to dirt or obstacles).

---

## Advantages
- **Easy to Design:** Simple to create and implement.  
- **Low Resource Requirements:** Minimal computing power required.  
- **Reliability:** Highly reliable if sensors are accurate and rules are well-defined.

---

## Limitations
- **Susceptible to Errors:** Fail if sensors malfunction or rules are incomplete.  
- **Difficulty in Unpredictable Situations:** Poor performance in changing environments.

- **Model-Based Reflex Agents:** Consider both:
  - Current percepts
  - Stored knowledge about the environment (even unseen parts)

### Understanding Percepts
- **Percept:** Information gathered from sensors (like vision, audio, or other data).
- Helps the agent understand its **current situation**.

---

## Decision-Making Process
1. **Perception:** Gather information from sensors.
2. **Internal Model:** Maintain a representation of:
   - Environment state
   - How it changes over time
   - How actions affect it
3. **Prediction:** Use the model to anticipate what might happen next.
4. **Reasoning:** Combine percepts + model knowledge to choose the best action.
5. **Execution:** Use actuators to carry out the decision (e.g., move, send commands).

---

## Key Features
- **Adaptability:** Continuously update the model with new information.
- **Reasoning Mechanisms:** Can use:
  - Rule-based logic
  - Logical inference
  - Machine learning techniques

---
