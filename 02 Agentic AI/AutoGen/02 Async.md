# AutoGen and Asynchronous Architecture

## Core Idea
AutoGen is built on an **asynchronous, event-driven architecture**.  
This means many operations run as **non-blocking tasks** that can overlap with each other instead of waiting for one to finish before starting the next.  


---

## Why It Matters
Async execution enables **multiple agents to work concurrently**, improving **throughput** and **responsiveness** in multi-agent workflows.  

---

## How It’s Implemented
- Most AutoGen functions are **coroutines** and must be `await`ed — they run asynchronously within an **event loop**.  

- The **orchestrator** dispatches tasks to worker agents (in layers) so they can process in **parallel** rather than strictly sequentially.  
 
- In practice, you may see explicit asynchronous function calls (e.g., timer-related or async actions) evidenced by logs like: “EXECUTING ASYNC FUNCTION ...”



## When to Use Which
- ✅ **Async (default in AutoGen):**  
Best for **I/O-bound tasks**, **long-running operations**, and scenarios where **multiple agents/tools can work simultaneously**.  

- ⚡ **Sync (simpler approach):**  
Suitable for **linear, CPU-bound tasks**, or when you want **straightforward debugging** and a **deterministic step-by-step flow**.  

---

## Quick Takeaway
AutoGen’s strength lies in **coordinating many agents in parallel** through async execution, boosting **efficiency** and **scalability** of multi-agent workflows.
