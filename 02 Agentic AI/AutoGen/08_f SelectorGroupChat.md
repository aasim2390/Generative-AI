## Best Use Cases for SelectorGroupChat

Think of `SelectorGroupChat` as a **team discussion** where not everyone talks in a fixed order.
Instead, there‚Äôs a **selector** (like a teacher or referee) who decides **which agent speaks** next based on the situation.

### üìå Best Situations to Use It
1. Dynamic Expertise Selection

üëâ Choose the right person for the job depending on the question.

#### Example:
- One agent is a **Writer**.
- One agent is a **Critic**.
- One agent is a **Summarizer**.
- The selector picks who should speak when.

### 2. Open-Ended or Multi-Step Tasks

üëâ When the answer depends on what was said before.

#### Example:
- First agent brainstorms ideas.
- Second agent improves them.
- Third agent picks the best one.

### 3. Quality Improvement or Review

üëâ A reviewer agent only jumps in if something looks wrong.

#### Example:
- Assistant writes a math solution.
- Critic checks: ‚ÄúIs this correct?‚Äù
- If yes ‚Üí done.
- If no ‚Üí critic asks assistant to fix.

### 4. Adaptive Workflows

üëâ The system decides who answers based on the question.

#### Example: Customer asks:
- ‚ÄúMy internet bill is wrong‚Äù ‚Üí **Billing Agent answers**.
- ‚ÄúMy WiFi is not working‚Äù ‚Üí **Tech Agent answers**.
- ‚ÄúWhat are your offers?‚Äù ‚Üí **General Agent answers**.

### üßë‚Äçüíª Simple Example (Dynamic Expertise)
```bash
!pip install "autogen-agentchat"
!pip install "autogen-ext[openai]"

```

```python
# ‚úÖ Colab + AutoGen: SelectorGroupChat with Assistant & Critic
# This script shows how to run a small multi-agent team where a selector
# chooses who speaks next. We stop after a fixed number of messages.

from google.colab import userdata          # Colab‚Äôs secret storage (Runtime > Secrets)
import os                                   # For environment variables
import asyncio                              # Async support (top-level await works in Colab/Jupyter)
from autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent
from autogen_agentchat.conditions import MaxMessageTermination
from autogen_agentchat.teams import SelectorGroupChat
from autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient
from autogen_agentchat.ui import Console    # Simple console renderer for streaming messages

# ‚õ≥ 1) Read your OpenAI API key from Colab secrets (set it beforehand in Colab)
OPENAI_API_KEY = userdata.get('OPENAI_API_KEY')

# üì¶ 2) Also put the key into an env var (many clients read from here by default)
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = OPENAI_API_KEY

# üß† 3) Initialize the model client (the LLM backend all agents will use)
#     - model: choose a chat model you have access to
#     - api_key: pass explicitly (also available via the env var above)
model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY
)

# üó£Ô∏è 4) Define the Assistant persona (answers clearly)
assistant = AssistantAgent(
    "Assistant",                     # Agent name (shows up as the speaker)
    model_client=model_client,       # Which LLM this agent uses
    system_message="You are a helpful assistant. Answer clearly."
)

# üßê 5) Define the Critic persona (reviews & improves Assistant‚Äôs output)
critic = AssistantAgent(
    "Critic",
    model_client=model_client,
    system_message="You are a critic. Review and improve the assistant's response."
)

# üõë 6) Termination rule: stop after 4 total messages produced during this run
#     (e.g., Assistant ‚Üí Critic ‚Üí Assistant ‚Üí Critic, then stop)
#     Increase this number for longer back-and-forth.
termination = MaxMessageTermination(max_messages=4)

# üë• 7) Build the SelectorGroupChat team
#     - The selector (internally) chooses which agent should speak next based on context.
#     - allow_repeated_speaker=True lets the same agent talk twice if the selector decides so.
team = SelectorGroupChat(
    [assistant, critic],                 # Participants in the team
    model_client=model_client,           # Used by the selector logic
    termination_condition=termination,   # When to stop the run
    allow_repeated_speaker=True          # Allow the same agent to speak consecutive turns
)

# üìù 8) Define the user task/prompt
task = "Explain why the sky is blue in simple terms."

# ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 9) Run the team and stream messages to the console UI
#     - In Colab/Jupyter, top-level `await` is allowed, so this works as-is.
#     - `Console(...)` renders messages as they arrive (streaming).
await Console(team.run_stream(task=task))

# üîö (Optional) If you were in a plain .py script (no top-level await),
# you would instead do:
# asyncio.run(Console(team.run_stream(task=task)))
#
# üîí (Optional) When done, you can close the model client:
# await model_client.close()

```

---------- TextMessage (user) ----------
Explain why the sky is blue in simple terms.
---------- TextMessage (Assistant) ----------
The sky is blue because of a process called scattering. When sunlight reaches Earth, it‚Äôs made up of different colors, each with different wavelengths. Blue light has a shorter wavelength than other colors. 

As sunlight passes through the atmosphere, it hits tiny particles and gases, which scatter the blue light much more than the other colors. Because of this scattering, when we look up at the sky during the day, we see more blue light coming from all directions, making the sky appear blue.
---------- TextMessage (Critic) ----------
The sky appears blue mainly because of a process called scattering. Sunlight is made up of many colors, like a rainbow, with each color having a different wavelength. Blue light has a shorter wavelength compared to other colors. 

When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it collides with tiny particles and gases. This collision scatters the blue light in all directions much more effectively than the other colors. As a result, when we look up at the sky during the day, we see more blue light than any other color, which makes the sky look blue.

To improve the explanation, you might also mention that during sunrise and sunset, the light has to travel through more of the atmosphere, scattering even more blue and green light away and allowing longer wavelengths like red and orange to dominate the sky's color at those times. This gives a fuller understanding of how the sky changes color throughout the day.

#### ‚úÖ Here‚Äôs what happens:

- Writer writes the answer.
- Critic checks it ‚Üí if it‚Äôs too long or unclear, asks for fixes.
- Summarizer makes it short and simple.
- Selector keeps choosing the best agent until task is done (or max rounds hit).
