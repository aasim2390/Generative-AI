# OpenAI

## Vision
Sam Altman, the CEO and cofounder of **OpenAI**, believes that **artificial intelligence (AI)** will become an even bigger part of our daily lives than smartphones.  
He has also mentioned that **AI agents** could be the next major breakthrough in technology, performing tasks that people truly want.

## OpenAI's AI Tools
To support this vision, OpenAI has created several AI systems, including:

- **GPTs**: Powerful language models designed to understand and generate human-like text.
- **Assistants API**: An interface that allows developers to build applications using OpenAI's AI capabilities.

## Getting Started
In the following sections, we will explore these tools and how they function.  
Before diving into the specifics, we will explain:

1. **How to create an OpenAI account**
2. **How to obtain an API key** — necessary to use these tools.

# Registering for the OpenAI API Key

# What are GPTs?

## Definition
**GPT** stands for *Generative Pre-trained Transformer*.  
It’s a customized version of **ChatGPT** that can combine:
- Specific **instructions**
- **Files**
- **APIs**  
to fit a particular use case.

## Analogy
Think of GPTs like **apps** you download from the iOS App Store or Google Play Store.

---

## Finding GPTs

# Building Your Own GPT

## Requirements
- **Paid account** is needed to create your own GPT.

## Steps to build Custom GPT


Follow these steps to create your own **custom GPT**:

---

## 1. Use the GPT Builder
Go to the [GPT Builder](https://chat.openai.com/gpts/editor).  
It will suggest:
- A **name** for your GPT
- A **profile picture**
- **Default prompts** (you can change or add more later)

<img width="400" height="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4bdb8bcc-0187-4350-a9e1-9a60ca5e2684" />

---

## 2. Write a Prompt
Start by writing a short description of what you want your GPT to do.

**Examples:**
- **Product Research:** "Gathers information on products, compares features, and provides reviews."
- **Event Planner:** "Suggests themes, creates mood boards, and finds vendors and venues."
- **Fashion Consultant:** "Offers style advice, generates outfit ideas, and finds the latest fashion trends."

---

## 3. Refine Your GPT
- Answer a few setup questions from the builder to improve your GPT.
- **Preview** your GPT on the right side of the screen.
- Once satisfied, click **"Create"** in the top-right corner.
- A menu will pop up to **save** the GPT and create a **shareable link**.

---

## 4. Customize the GPT
Go to the **Configure** tab on the right side to:
- **Change Profile Picture**
- **Edit Prompt Suggestions**
- **Update Main Instructions**

---

## 5. Knowledge Feature
Upload documents (PDFs, text files, etc.) to give your GPT more information and make it more specialized.

---

## 6. Add Capabilities
Enable extra features like:
- **Web Browsing:** Look up live information online.
- **Image Generation:** Create AI-generated images.
- **Code Interpreter:** Solve problems with Python.

---

## 7. Use Actions
Connect your GPT to other services for extended functionality:
- Slack
- Notion
- Zapier

# Important Considerations for Custom GPTs

---

## 1. Access
**What It Means:** You can only use your custom GPTs within the **ChatGPT platform**.  
**Why It Matters:** To interact with your GPT, you must log in to ChatGPT.  
You cannot use it directly in other apps or websites without additional tools.

---

## 2. Integration
**What It Means:** To use your custom GPT in another website or application, you need the **Assistants API**.  
**Why It Matters:** The Assistants API lets developers connect your GPT's functionalities to other platforms, enabling it to work **outside of ChatGPT**.


>   The **Assistants API** does not directly connect to your actual *Custom GPT* from ChatGPT.
>
> Instead, it allows you to **create a new Assistant** in the API that you can configure to behave like your Custom GPT by copying:
> - **Instructions/Personality**
> - **Knowledge base files**  
> - **Tools you configured** (except browsing, which isn’t available in API) 

---

## 3. Monetization
**What It Means:** Currently, you **cannot earn money** from your custom GPTs.  
**Why It Matters:** While you can create and share GPTs, charging users or generating income is not yet supported.  
OpenAI plans to allow monetization in the future.

---

## 4. User Privacy
**What It Means:** Developers **cannot view** the conversations users have with their GPTs.  
**Why It Matters:** This ensures **privacy protection**, allowing users to interact without fear of being monitored by the developer.

---

## 5. Enterprise Use
**What It Means:** The **Enterprise edition** of ChatGPT lets organizations create GPTs intended for **internal use only**.  
**Why It Matters:** Businesses can build GPTs tailored to their needs while keeping sensitive information private and secure within the organization.

---

These considerations will help you design GPTs that are functional, secure, and aligned with your intended use.
