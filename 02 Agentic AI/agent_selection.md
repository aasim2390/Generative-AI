# Choosing an AI Agent Framework

AI agent frameworks are like different ways of building a team of smart robots.  
Some give you lots of control but require more work, while others do more for you but give you less control.

## Quick Comparison

| Framework            | How “Automatic” It Feels     | What’s Special                                          | How Hard to Learn | How Much You Control | How Simple It Feels |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **OpenAI Agents SDK**| Low-level (you do most work) | Python-first, guardrails, direct control               | Easy              | High                 | Simple              |
| **CrewAI**           | Medium                      | Roles, teamwork between agents                         | Easy-Medium       | Medium               | Medium              |
| **AutoGen**          | High (does a lot)            | Chat-style agents, human-in-the-loop                   | Medium            | Medium               | Medium              |
| **Google ADK**       | Medium                      | Multi-agent hierarchies, Google Cloud tools, streaming | Medium            | Medium-High          | Medium              |
| **LangGraph**        | Low-Medium                  | Graph workflows, state management                      | Very Hard         | Very High            | Low                 |
| **Dapr Agents**      | Medium                      | Event-driven, Kubernetes-ready, 50+ data connectors    | Medium            | Medium-High          | Medium              |

## Points to Remember

### 1. Abstraction = How much the framework does for you
- **Low abstraction** → You do more coding & control everything.  
- **High abstraction** → It does more automatically, but gives you less freedom.

### 2. Control vs. Simplicity Trade-off
- More control usually means harder to learn.  
- Easier tools may limit what you can customize.

### 3. Match to Your Goal
- **Want full power & customization?** → OpenAI Agents SDK, LangGraph  
- **Want quick teamwork setup?** → CrewAI, AutoGen  
- **Want big ecosystem?** → Google ADK, Dapr Agents  

### 4. Learning Curve Matters
- If you’re new, start with simple tools and move up as you gain skills.
