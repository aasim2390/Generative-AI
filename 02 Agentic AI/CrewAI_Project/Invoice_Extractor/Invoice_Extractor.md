## CrewAI Invoice Executor

This project demonstrates a powerful and scalable solution for automated invoice data extraction using a multi-agent system powered by CrewAI. 
It leverages a combination of optical character recognition (OCR) and large language models (LLMs) to accurately parse and extract key information from unstructured invoice documents.

## Key Features
- **Automated Data Extraction:** Automatically identifies and extracts crucial data points like invoice number, total amount, due date, and line items.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Built on the CrewAI framework, the system uses a team of specialized AI agents working together, making it easy to add more agents or tasks.
- **OCR Integration:** Uses PyTesseract for robust text recognition from images.
- **Flexible Parsing:** Utilizes Unstructured and LangChain to handle a wide variety of document formats.

## Technologies Used
- **CrewAI:** The orchestration framework for the multi-agent system.
- **LangChain:** For building powerful LLM-powered applications.
- **Unstructured:** For parsing and cleaning data from diverse document types.
- **PyTesseract:** A Python wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine.
- **Tesseract OCR:** The open-source OCR engine.
- **Python:** The core programming language.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, you need to install the Tesseract OCR engine and the required Python libraries.

```python
!pip install pytesseract -q
!sudo apt update
!sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
```

```bash
!pip install langchain-community --upgrade
!pip install unstructured --upgrade
!pip install crewai --upgrade
!pip install crewai-tools --upgrade

```

## Project Code
Here is the complete Python code for the invoice extraction system.

            # Convert page to image and run OCR
            pix = page.get_pixmap()

## How to Run
- Clone this repository.
- Install the prerequisites as described above.
- Replace the placeholder for OPENAI_API_KEY with your actual API key.
- Place your invoice file (e.g., invoice.pdf) in a location and update the invoice_file_path variable in the script.
- Run the script from your terminal:

  ```python
  run_crew(pdf_path)
  ```

  ## Example Output
After running the script, the console output will show the extracted and validated invoice data in a structured JSON format.
