# Prompting Approach, Best Practices, and Examples

## 1. Approach to Prompting
Think of prompting as **talking to a robot who’s super smart but doesn’t guess your mind**.  
You have to be:
- **Clear** → No vague words.
- **Specific** → Tell it exactly what you want.
- **Structured** → Give a format to follow.
- **Step-by-step** → Break down big jobs.

## 2. Best Practices

| Best Practice         | Why It Works                     | Example |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|---------|
| **Be Specific**       | Avoids vague responses           | ❌ "Tell me about history" → ✅ "Summarize the American Civil War in 5 bullet points" |
| **Give a Role**       | Matches tone & perspective       | "You are a travel guide. Create a 3-day plan for Paris." |
| **Use Step-by-Step**  | Improves reasoning                | "List steps to solve this math problem before giving the answer." |
| **Give Examples**     | Helps AI copy style               | "Write a tweet like: 'Monday mood: coffee before code ☕💻'" |
| **Set Output Format** | Saves editing                     | "Return the answer in a JSON with fields: name, age, hobby." |
| **Ask for Alternatives** | Sparks creativity             | "Suggest 3 catchy slogans for a bakery." |

## 3. Types of Prompting with Expanded Examples

### A. Direct Prompting
Simple request.
> **Example:**  
> "List 5 tallest mountains in the world with their heights."

---

### B. Role-Based Prompting
Give the AI a persona.
> **Example:**  
> "You are a sports commentator. Describe the last World Cup final in an exciting tone."

---

### C. Chain-of-Thought Prompting
Ask the AI to think aloud step-by-step.
> **Example:**  
> "Explain how you solved: 15% of 200."

---

### D. Few-Shot Prompting
Show a few examples first.

Q: Capital of Italy? → Rome
Q: Capital of Germany? → Berlin
Q: Capital of Spain? →


---

### E. Instruction + Context Prompting
Give background info.
> **Example:**  
> "Write a 150-word article about recycling for kids under 12. Use fun examples."

---

### F. Multi-Step Prompting
Ask for answers in sequence.
> **Example:**  
> "Step 1: Give me 3 ideas for a short story. Step 2: Expand the second idea into a 200-word story."

---

### G. Creative Constraint Prompting
Set limits for creativity.
> **Example:**  
> "Write a scary story in exactly 4 sentences."

---

### H. Refinement Prompting
Ask for edits.
> **Example:**  
> "Make this paragraph sound more professional and remove slang."

---

### I. ReAct Prompting *(Reason + Act)*
The AI reasons step-by-step, then takes an action.
> **Example:**  
> "You are solving a puzzle. First, think about the problem logically. Then, choose an action from: [Search, Calculate, Summarize].  
> Problem: What is the population of Tokyo?"

---

### J. Tree of Thoughts (ToT)
The AI explores multiple reasoning paths, compares them, then picks the best.
> **Example:**  
> "You are brainstorming ways to improve school lunches. Think of 3 different ideas, list pros and cons for each, then pick the most practical one."

## 4. Common Prompting Issues to Avoid

| Mistake                  | Why It’s a Problem         | Fix |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|-----|
| **Being Vague**          | Leads to generic answers   | Be specific with details, limits, and tone. |
| **Too Many Tasks in One Prompt** | Confuses the AI    | Break into smaller prompts. |
| **No Context**           | Output might be off-topic  | Add background info. |
| **No Format**            | Messy output               | Ask for lists, tables, or JSON. |
| **Overstuffing Keywords**| AI gets confused           | Keep language natural. |
| **Ignoring Iteration**   | First answer isn’t always best | Ask for refinements or alternatives. |

## 🧠 Memory Hook to remember — "R.I.C.E. P.O.T."
- **R**ole → Tell the AI who it is.  
- **I**nstructions → What to do.  
- **C**ontext → Why/for whom.  
- **E**xamples → Show samples.  
- **P**lan Steps → Break tasks down.  
- **O**utput Format → How to present it.  
- **T**ry Again → Refine the result.
