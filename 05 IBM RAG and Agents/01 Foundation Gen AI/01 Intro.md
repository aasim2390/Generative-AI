- **AI is evolving** – it’s no longer just answering questions, it can now reason, plan, and act.

- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation):** Helps AI give better answers by fetching real-time info.

- **Multimodal AI:** Can handle text, images, audio, and video together.

- **Agentic AI:** Lets AI act like an agent – reasoning, planning, and doing tasks on its own.

- These can work separately or combine to create **powerful AI systems.**


# 📘 Introduction to Generative AI  

## 🤖 What is AI?  
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** When machines try to **think and learn like humans**.  
- AI learns from lots of data → this process is called **training**.

## 🔍 Two Main Types of AI  

### 1. Discriminative AI (Classifier AI)  
- Focus: **Identify / classify** things.  
- Example: Spam filter → “Is this email spam or not spam?”  
- Good for: **Predictions and decisions**, not creativity.  

### 2. Generative AI (Creative AI)  
- Focus: **Create new things** from what it learned.  
- Works with prompts → input can be text, image, video, etc.  
- Example: “Draw a nest with 3 eggs” → AI creates the picture.  
- Can do **text-to-text, text-to-image, image-to-video**, etc.  
- Goes beyond analysis → it **mimics creativity**.

## 🧠 How Generative AI Works  
- Uses **deep learning** → artificial neural networks (like tiny versions of the brain).  
- Famous models:  
  - **GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)**  
  - **VAEs (Variational Autoencoders)**  
  - **Transformers**  
  - **Diffusion models**

## ⏳ Short History of Generative AI  
- **1950s:** First ideas of machine learning.  
- **1990s:** Neural networks grew.  
- **2010s:** Deep learning + big data → big progress.  
- **2014:** GANs introduced → huge leap forward.  
- **2018 onwards:** Transformers → led to **LLMs (Large Language Models)**.

## 🏆 Popular Generative AI Models & Tools  
- **Text:** GPT (ChatGPT), Google PaLM, Meta LLaMA  
- **Images:** DALL·E, Stable Diffusion, MidJourney  
- **Video:** Synthesia  
- **Code:** Copilot, AlphaCode  

---

## 💡 Why is Generative AI Important?  
- Can generate **text, images, video, code, music, and more**.  
- Boosts both **decision-making** and **creativity**.  
- Helps workers by **automating repetitive tasks**.  
- McKinsey predicts it could add **trillions of dollars** to the global economy.

## ✅ Key Takeaways  
- **Discriminative AI → classify (spam vs not spam).**  
- **Generative AI → create (write a poem, draw a picture, make code).**  
- Built using **GANs, VAEs, transformers, diffusion models**.  
- Today, generative AI is powering tools across **many industries** and shaping the **future of work**.
