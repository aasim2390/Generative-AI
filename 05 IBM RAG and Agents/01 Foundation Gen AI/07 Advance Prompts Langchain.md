# 🚀 Advanced Prompt Engineering for LLMs & Generative AI

---

## 🎯 What You’ll Learn
- Advanced prompt methods: **Zero-shot, One-shot, Few-shot, Chain-of-Thought, Self-consistency**  
- Tools for prompt engineering: **LangChain, OpenAI Playground, Hugging Face, IBM AI Classroom**  
- How AI **agents** use prompts to perform complex tasks

## 🔹 Prompting Methods

### 1️⃣ Zero-Shot Prompt
- **Definition:** LLM performs a task **without any prior examples**.  
- **Example:**  
  Prompt: *“The Eiffel Tower is located in Berlin. True or False?”*  
  GPT-4 responds: **False**  
- **Use Case:** Instant question answering or classification without training.

---

### 2️⃣ One-Shot Prompt
- **Definition:** LLM gets **one example** to guide a similar task.  
- **Example:**  
  1. Example: *“Translate: How is the weather today? → Comment ça va aujourd’hui ?”*  
  2. Task: *“Where is the nearest supermarket?”* → GPT outputs: *“Où est le supermarché le plus proche ?”*  
- **Use Case:** Quickly teach LLM a translation format, style, or reasoning.

---

### 3️⃣ Few-Shot Prompt
- **Definition:** LLM sees **a few examples** to generalize to new tasks.  
- **Example:**  
  Teach GPT to classify emotions:  
  - *“I love this movie!” → Happy*  
  - *“I’m so tired today.” → Sad*  
  - *“That movie was so scary. I had to cover my eyes.” → Scared*  
- **Use Case:** Sentiment analysis, emotion detection, or text classification.

---

### 4️⃣ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting
- **Definition:** Guides LLMs **step-by-step** like human reasoning.  
- **Example (Math Problem):**  
  *“A store had 22 apples, sold 15, then received 8 more. How many apples now?”*  
  GPT thinks:  
  1. 22 − 15 = 7 apples left  
  2. 7 + 8 = 15 apples total  
  ✅ Answer: 15 apples  
- **Use Case:** Complex reasoning, multi-step calculations, logic puzzles.

---

### 5️⃣ Self-Consistency
- **Definition:** Generate **multiple independent answers** and pick the most consistent.  
- **Example:**  
  Problem: *“I was 6, my sister was half my age. Now I’m 70. How old is she?”*  
  GPT produces 3 calculations → all point to **67 years**.  
- **Use Case:** Improves reliability for reasoning or math tasks.

## 🔹 Tools for Prompt Engineering
| Tool | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| OpenAI Playground | Test prompts in real-time | Write poems, summarize text |
| Hugging Face | Access pre-trained LLMs | GPT, BERT, T5 |
| IBM AI Classroom | Learning & experimenting | Sentiment analysis projects |
| LangChain | Use **prompt templates** & build agents | Create a joke generator or Q&A bot |

---

## 🔹 LangChain + Prompt Templates
- **Template Example:**  
```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

# Create a PromptTemplate object. This defines a reusable prompt with placeholder variables.
joke_template = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["adjective", "topic"],  # Names of the variables that will be substituted later
    template="Tell me a {adjective} joke about {topic}."  # The prompt text that uses those variables
)

# Fill in the template's placeholders by providing concrete values for the variables.
# The format method substitutes {adjective} with "funny" and {topic} with "chickens".
prompt = joke_template.format(adjective="funny", topic="chickens")

# Print the resulting concrete prompt. This is what you would send to a model or use as input.
print(prompt)  # Output: Tell me a funny joke about chickens.

 
# Output: Tell me a funny joke about chickens.
```

- **Benefit**: Makes prompts **consistent, reusable, and adaptable**.

### 🔹 Agents Powered by LLMs

- **Definition:** : AI systems using prompts + tools to perform tasks automatically.
- **Example:**
  - **Q&A Agent:** Answers questions using multiple sources
  - **Content Agent:** Writes summaries, blog posts, or stories
  - **Analytic Agent:** Processes business data & generates reports
  - **Multilingual Agent:** Translates text contextually across languages

---
  
### 🔹 Recap

- **Advanced prompt methods:** Zero-shot, One-shot, Few-shot, CoT, Self-consistency
- **Tools:** LangChain, Playground, Hugging Face, IBM AI Classroom
- **Agents:** Combine prompts + LLMs for complex tasks across domains
- **Key Idea:** Prompt engineering is like teaching your AI how to think, step by step, without retraining the whole model.

### 💡 Tip to Remember:
> Think of prompts as instructions for your AI co-pilot. Zero-shot = “jump in and do it,” Few-shot = “learn from a few examples,” CoT = “think out loud,” Self-consistency = “double-check yourself.”
