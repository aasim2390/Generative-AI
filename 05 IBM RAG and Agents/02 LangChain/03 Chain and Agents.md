# üìò LangChain Essentials with OpenAI Models

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is LangChain?

- A framework to build AI-powered apps using LLMs (Large Language Models).
- Helps integrate language understanding + reasoning + external tools.
- Core building blocks: **Chains, Memory, Agents.**

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Chains

- **üîó Definition:** A sequence of steps where each output becomes the next input.
   - **Sequential Chain** = fixed pipeline.
   - **Steps Example:**
       1. Location ‚Üí Famous dish (China ‚Üí Peking Duck)
       2. Dish ‚Üí Recipe (Peking Duck ‚Üí Recipe)
       3. Recipe ‚Üí Cooking Time (Recipe ‚Üí 2 hours)

  ### ‚úÖ How to build:
    - Define prompt template.
    - Create LLMChain using ChatOpenAI.
    - Combine multiple chains into a SequentialChain.
    - Use `verbose=True` to trace execution.

  #### üß† Memorable Hook: Chains = Dominoes (fall in order).

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Memory
 - **üíæ Definition:** Stores and recalls conversation context.
    - Reads memory before processing.
    - Writes new inputs/outputs after execution.
    - Class: `ChatMessageHistory`, `ConversationBufferMemory`.
  
  ### ‚úÖ Why it matters:
     - Without memory = talking to a stranger.
     - With memory = talking to a friend who remembers yesterday.

  #### üß† Memorable Hook: Memory = Diary (keeps history safe).

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Agents
- **ü§ñ Definition:** Dynamic decision-makers that pick tools at runtime.
   - **Difference from Chains:**
       - Chains = fixed steps.
       - Agents = flexible, decide which tool/chain to use.

   - Tools they use: Search engines, APIs, databases, Pandas DataFrames.

  ### ‚úÖ Example: Pandas DataFrame Agent
    - Input: "How many rows in the DataFrame?"
    - LLM ‚Üí writes Python code ‚Üí executes ‚Üí returns result.


  #### üß† Memorable Hook: Agents = Smart Assistants (choose the right tool).

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Code Example (Chains + Memory + Agent)

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import LLMChain, SequentialChain
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain_experimental.agents import create_pandas_dataframe_agent
import pandas as pd
```
#### Chain Example 

```python
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Initialize the model (OpenAI GPT)
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# llm is the brain (language model) we will ask questions to.
# We use the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model. Temperature=0 means we want very predictable,
# repeatable answers (no randomness).
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0)

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2. Memory Setup
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A ConversationBufferMemory can store past messages (chat history).
# This is useful if you want the model to remember earlier chats,
# but we won't use it in this simple sequential chain.
# memory = ConversationBufferMemory() # Memory is not used in SequentialChain below

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 3. Chains Example (Sequential Workflow)
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A "Chain" is a mini-step that runs a prompt through the model and gives back an answer.
# Each chain has:
# - input_variables: what you must provide to run this step
# - an output_key: the name used to store the result from this step

# Chain 1: Find a famous dish by location
dish_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["location"],
    template="What is a famous dish in {location}?"
)
# Dish chain: run the dish_prompt, store the answer as "meal"
dish_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=dish_prompt, output_key="meal")

# Chain 2: Get the recipe for that dish
recipe_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["meal"],
    template="Give me a simple recipe for {meal}."
)
recipe_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=recipe_prompt, output_key="recipe")

# Chain 3: Estimate cooking time for the recipe
time_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["recipe"],
    template="Estimate the cooking time for this recipe: {recipe}"
)
time_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=time_prompt, output_key="time")

# Combine all 3 chains into one sequential pipeline
# The SequentialChain runs each chain in order, passing outputs along:
# - The first chain uses the provided input
# - The second chain uses the first chain's "meal" output as its input
# - The third chain uses the second chain's "recipe" output as its input
food_chain = SequentialChain(
    chains=[dish_chain, recipe_chain, time_chain],
    input_variables=["location"],           # User provides a location (e.g., "China")
    output_variables=["meal", "recipe", "time"], # Final outputs from the whole chain
    verbose=True,                           # Show detailed steps as it runs (helpful for learning)
)

# Run the chain: ask about a famous dish in China
print("\n--- Running Chain Example ---")
print(food_chain.invoke({"location": "China"}))
```

```bash

--- Running Chain Example ---


> Entering new SequentialChain chain...

> Finished chain.
{'location': 'China', 'meal': 'One famous dish in China is Peking duck, which is a traditional dish from Beijing. It is a roasted duck dish that is prized for its crispy skin and tender meat. Peking duck is often served with thin pancakes, scallions, cucumber, and hoisin sauce, and is considered a delicacy in Chinese cuisine.', 'recipe': 'Ingredients:\n- 1 whole duck\n- 1 tablespoon honey\n- 1 tablespoon soy sauce\n- 1 tablespoon hoisin sauce\n- 1 teaspoon five-spice powder\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Thin pancakes\n- Sliced scallions\n- Sliced cucumber\n\nInstructions:\n1.

Enjoy your homemade Peking duck!', 'time': 'The estimated cooking time for this recipe is about 1.5-2 hours.'}
```

#### Agent Example
```python
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 4. Agent Example (Dynamic Tool Usage)
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Agents decide what action/tool to use dynamically.
# Example: Pandas DataFrame Agent that can answer questions on data.

# Import pandas to work with tabular data (DataFrame)
import pandas as pd  # standard alias for pandas

# Create a small DataFrame (a table) with two columns: Name and Score
df = pd.DataFrame({"Name": ["John", "Bob"], "Score": [88, 92]})

# Create an agent that can query the DataFrame using natural language
# - llm: the language model we already set up earlier (gpt-like brain)
# - df: the DataFrame we want to query with natural language questions
# - verbose=True: print extra internal steps so you can see how it works
# - allow_dangerous_code=True: allow the agent to generate and run Python code
#   (use with caution; this can be risky if used with unknown input)
agent = create_pandas_dataframe_agent(llm, df, verbose=True, allow_dangerous_code=True)

# Ask a question in plain English ‚Üí the agent converts it to Python code internally
print("\n--- Running Agent Example ---")
print(agent.invoke({"input": "What is the average score?"}))
```

```bash
--- Running Agent Example ---


> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
Thought: To find the average score, we need to calculate the mean of the 'Score' column in the dataframe.
Action: python_repl_ast
Action Input: df['Score'].mean()90.0The average score is 90.0.
Final Answer: 90.0

> Finished chain.
{'input': 'What is the average score?', 'output': '90.0'}
```

#### Memory Example
```python
# Step 1: Import the necessary building blocks
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI          # The "brain" we ask questions to (a chat model)
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain  # A chain that keeps a back-and-forth chat
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory  # Keeps track of past messages in memory

# Step 1: Initialize LLM
# Create the language model object with a chosen model and creativity level
# - model="gpt-4o-mini": which version of the model to use (smaller, faster)
# - temperature=0.7: how creative/different the answers can be (0.0 = deterministic)
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0.7)

# Step 2: Add memory so it remembers the conversation
# ConversationBufferMemory stores the chat history in memory.
# return_messages=True means the memory will provide the history back to the chain
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(return_messages=True)

# Step 3: Create the chain
# A ConversationChain ties together the LLM and the memory to handle a back-and-forth chat.
conversation = ConversationChain(llm=llm, memory=memory)

# Step 4: Interact (memory remembers previous inputs/outputs)
# We ask the model to suggest a dish, then ask for a recipe, then ask about cooking time.
print(conversation.invoke({"input": "Suggest a Chinese dish."}))
print(conversation.invoke({"input": "Give me the recipe."}))
print(conversation.invoke({"input": "How long will it take to cook?"}))
```
