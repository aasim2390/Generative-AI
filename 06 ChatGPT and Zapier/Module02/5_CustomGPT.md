# 🚀 Custom GPTs: Your Own Super AI App!

We’ve learned how **Agentic AI** can think, plan, use tools, learn from examples, and even be given a unique personality.  
Now, let's see how all those ideas come together in **Custom GPTs** — AI you design yourself!

## ✨ What is a Custom GPT? *(Your Personalized AI)*
Think of your favorite video game character.  
Now imagine you could give them **new superpowers** and **secret knowledge** only you know.  
That’s what a **Custom GPT** is like!

It’s:

> **ChatGPT + Your Rules + Your Knowledge + Your Tools = Your Custom GPT**


You can:
- Give it **permanent instructions** on how to respond.
- Upload **extra knowledge** so it knows specific things.
- Connect it to **real-world tools** so it can take action.

## 🧩 How a Custom GPT Works

### 1. **Instructions** (Your “Permanent Programming”)
This is where you give your GPT fixed personality & behavior rules.

**Example Rules:**
- “Always explain like a friendly, energetic coach for an 8th grader.”
- “Turn any list of facts into a fun quiz.”
- “Refuse to answer anything not safe for kids.”

---

### 2. **Extra Knowledge** (Your GPT’s Special Library — Powered by RAG)
Upload files like:
- Your school handbook.
- A company policy guide.
- A recipe collection.

The GPT will use these documents to answer questions accurately — even if it wasn’t trained on them.

**Example:**
- Upload your school club rules.
- Ask: *“How do I become club president?”*
- GPT answers using your document: *“You must attend 5 meetings, win at least one competition, and get 3 member recommendations.”*

---

### 3. **Skills** (Real-World Actions)
Connect your GPT to apps & services so it can:
- Add events to your **Google Calendar**.
- Send emails via **Gmail**.
- Post updates to **Slack**.
- Organize files in **Dropbox**.

*(Tools - We’ll cover this in detail later!)*
