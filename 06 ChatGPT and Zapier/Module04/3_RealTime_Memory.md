# 🧠 Agentic AI’s Superpower: Finding Info on Demand!
*(Information Access as a Tool)*

We know AI’s brain usually **freezes** at its last training date, and it forgets past conversations.  
But what if it needs **brand new information** or **very specific details** that weren’t in its training?

---

## ✨ The Problem: AI Doesn’t Know Everything — Especially What’s NEW!
Think of your AI as a brilliant student who has read every textbook.  
The problem?  
If you ask:
- “What’s the score of today’s basketball game?”
- “Who won the local hotdog eating contest last night?”

…it won’t know, because those events happened **after** the textbooks were printed.

---

## 🚀 The Solution: "Information Access" as a Tool
Just like an AI can:
- Add calendar events
- Log expenses

…we can give it a **"research assistant" tool** for finding new information.

When the AI realizes it doesn’t know something, it can decide:  
> “I need to use my **research tool** to go find that info.”

## 📚 Example 1: The BMX Race Champion (Hard-to-Find Info)
**You Ask:**  
> “Who was the 2023 Tennessee 9 Intermediate BMX State Champion?”

**AI’s Plan:**
1. Realizes it likely doesn’t know from training data.  
2. Uses **Web Browsing Tool** to search.  

**The Catch:**  
- The internet might have **incomplete or wrong info**.  
- If the AI finds a confusing or unreliable source, it might **guess** — which we want to avoid.

**Lesson:**  
A search tool is powerful, but the AI needs **rules** for when and how to trust what it finds.

## ⏱ Example 2: Next BMX Practice (Constantly Changing Info)
**You Ask:**  
> “When is the next practice at Music City BMX?”

**AI’s Plan:**
1. Recognizes this is a **schedule** → schedules change frequently.  
2. Immediately searches for “next practice Music City BMX.”  
3. Finds the official website and reads the schedule.

**Result:**  
You get the exact, up-to-date practice time.

**Why This Works:**  
The AI knows **when** it should use its info-access tool — especially for time-sensitive data.

## 📝 Teaching Your AI When and How to Research
To make your AI a **smart researcher**, give it clear rules in its instructions:

### ✅ When to Use the Tool
- **Always use** web browsing for:
  - Schedules
  - News
  - Prices
  - Anything that changes often
- Use **private data tools** (e.g., "Club Roster Access") for:
  - Internal lists
  - Private documents
  - Project-specific info
- Skip searching for:
  - Well-known, stable facts (e.g., “Capital of the USA”)

### ✅ How Much to Trust the Results
- Only use results if there’s an **exact match** to what’s needed.
- If info is **unclear or conflicting**:
  - Say *"I’m not sure"* instead of guessing.

### ✅ Prioritizing Information
- Sometimes you want:
  - **Only** the newly found data.
  - Ignore older knowledge from training.
- Tell it:  
  > “Using **only** the information you just found, answer the question.”
