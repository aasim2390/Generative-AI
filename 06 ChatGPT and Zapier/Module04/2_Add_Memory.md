# 🧠 Agentic AI: Giving Your Helper a REAL Memory! (No More Forgetting!)

Remember how AI usually forgets everything from past conversations?  
Starting a new chat wipes its brain clean — so our **Travel Expense Helper GPT** might **log the same receipt twice** if we send it in a new conversation.

---

## ✨ The Problem: AI’s Brain Reset
- **New Chat = Fresh Start** → No past knowledge, no history.
- Like having an **intern** who’s great at tasks, but **wakes up every morning with amnesia**.
- Result: Lots of duplicate work.

---

## 🚀 The Solution: Memory as a "Tool"

The fix?  
**Give our Agentic AI a permanent memory** it can check any time — just like it uses a web browser or calendar tool.

---

### 🛠 How We Build the Memory Tool (with Zapier)

1. **Create a Zapier Action**  
   - Use the “Get Many Spreadsheet Rows” action in Zapier.  
   - Connect it to the **Google Sheet** where expenses are logged.

2. **Define the Memory Size**  
   - Decide how many recent entries the AI should check each time.  
   - Example: **20 most recent expenses**.
     - ✅ Keeps the focus on the most relevant items.
     - ✅ Avoids sending 500+ old entries that might cost more and confuse the AI.
   - This is **rolling memory** → remembers the latest important things.

3. **Name the Tool Clearly**  
   - Example: `get_travel_expenses`  
   - Clear names help the AI pick the right tool at the right time.

### 📜 Teaching the GPT to Use Its Memory

In your **Custom GPT Instructions**, add this **Golden Rule**:

Before you add any travel expenses, do the following: <br>
- Get my current travel expenses using the get_travel_expenses tool.<br>
- Check if the new expense already exists in the retrieved list.<br>
- If it looks like a duplicate, confirm with the user before adding it.<br>


**Why this works:**  
We’re making the AI follow a **Think → Check → Act** cycle:
1. **Observe** (fetch memory)
2. **Think** (compare entries)
3. **Act** (add or ask for confirmation)

---

## 🌟 The Magic: AI Remembers and Prevents Mistakes

Example — Adding a Duplicate:
- **You:** “Add $15 lunch from yesterday.”
- **AI’s Plan:**  
  1. Pull recent expenses.  
  2. Compare new entry with memory.  
  3. Detect duplicate.  
- **AI’s Response:**  
  _"It looks like you already added a $15 lunch expense for yesterday. Do you want to add it again?"_

✅ No more duplicates — even in **new chats**.

---

## 🚀 The Power of External Memory

- **Better Decisions** → AI acts with real context.
- **Error Prevention** → Stops repeat entries before they happen.
- **Long-Term Personalization** → Knows your history and preferences over time.

Giving your Agentic AI **real memory** is a **huge step** toward making it a truly intelligent, reliable, and personalized assistant.

## Steps taken:

1. Add a new action - "Get Travel Expenses" as a memory.

2. Modified the Instruction:

```
   You are going to help me catalog my travel expenses. Whenever I give you new expense, you will use add the travel expense action.

Before you add any expenses, do the following:
1. Get my current expenses and check if this expenses already entered. If it appears to be duplicate, confirm if I want to add it anyway.

### Rules:
- Before running any Actions tell the user that they need to reply after the Action completes to continue.

### Instructions for Zapier AI Actions:
Step 1. Check for required action(s):
    - Call `list_available_actions` to generate available actions list
    - If required action exists → Step 4
    - If not → Step 2
Step 2. For missing required action(s):
    - Send configuration link
    - Wait for user to confirm they've configured the required action
Step 3. After user confirms configuration → proceed to Step 4 with original request
Step 4. Execute `run_action`:
    - Use the action ID from the results array of the `list_available_actions` response
    - Fill in required parameters based on user request

Required Actions:
- Action: "add_travel_expense"
- Action: "Get Travel Expenses"

```
  
3. Now, GPT is confirming to add duplicates or not
