# 💸 My Super Smart Travel Expense GPT: No More Lost Receipts!

Ever hate dealing with **travel expenses and receipts** after a trip?  
I do! It’s a real pain to keep track of everything and make those reports.

So, I’m building my very own **Custom GPT** to handle it **automatically**.

---

## 😫 The Problem I Hate: Travel Expenses

When I travel for work or other trips:

- I **always lose receipts** 😭  
- I forget little things I bought that I could get reimbursed for  
- Making expense reports is **boring** and time-consuming  
- I miss items I should claim (like that breakfast I forgot to log)

---

## 💡 My Dream Solution (with AI!)

A **super easy** way to track everything without stress:

1. **📸 Snap a Picture**  
   Just take a photo of any receipt — my AI logs it automatically.

2. **🗣 Say It Out Loud**  
   No receipt? Just tell my AI:  
   > “I spent $15 on lunch at the burger place.”

3. **📊 Automatic Logging**  
   AI extracts the details (amount, vendor, date) and stores them in my **Google Sheet** — no manual typing.

4. **🔍 Catching Missing Stuff**  
   AI notices gaps and asks:  
   > “You didn’t log breakfast for Tuesday — did you eat out?”

5. **📑 Easy Reports**  
   At the end of the trip, AI creates a **perfect expense report** and even drafts the email to send.

## 🚀 How My GPT Will Work (Agentic AI in Action)

### 1. 🧠 The Brain — My Custom GPT
- Personalized to focus **only** on travel expense tracking.
- Knows my workflow and rules for expenses.

### 2. 📝 The Memory — Google Sheet
- Central “expense notebook” where every entry is stored.
- AI can **read & write** to this sheet.

### 3. 🔌 The Magic Pipe — Zapier Connection
- Acts as a **universal translator** between GPT and Google Sheets (and other apps).
- Handles security and the actual “API” work.

## ⚙️ AI’s Superpowers in This Setup

### 👁️ Observe & 💪 Act — Logging Expenses
1. I take a photo of a receipt.  
2. GPT “sees” it (multi-modal input).  
3. GPT extracts:
   - Amount
   - Vendor
   - Date  
4. GPT sends data to Zapier → Zapier adds a **new row** in Google Sheet.

**If I speak instead of taking a photo:**  
- GPT transcribes my words.  
- Sends the same info to Zapier → Google Sheet.

---

### 🧠 Think & Plan — Catching Forgotten Meals
- GPT compares my trip dates to the expenses in Google Sheet.
- Notices gaps:  
  > “You logged lunch and dinner for Tuesday, but no breakfast. Did you have breakfast out?”

---

### 💪 Act — Generating Reports & Emails
When I say:  
> “Prepare my report for the trip to Chicago.”

GPT will:
1. Retrieve all expenses for that trip from Google Sheet (via Zapier/RAG).
2. Format them into a **professional report**.
3. Draft an **email** to my reimbursement contact.
4. Send the email using Zapier’s email tool.

---

### 👀 Watch & Learn — Feedback Loop
- Zapier confirms actions:  

- GPT uses this info to confirm success or fix problems.

---

## 🎯 The Goal: Super Automation
This project brings **all Agentic AI concepts together**:
- **Planning** & proactive checks
- **Tool usage** (Zapier + Google Sheets + Email)
- **Feedback loops** for smart error handling
- **RAG** for pulling stored expense data
- **Multi-modal input** (photos + voice)

When it’s done, I’ll have a **real, automatic assistant** that:
- Tracks my expenses  
- Catches mistakes  
- Creates reports  
- Saves me hours of boring work
