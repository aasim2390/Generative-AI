# 🚀 Connecting Your Custom GPT to the World: Zapier Actions!

We’re about to give our **Custom GPT** its most powerful upgrade yet —  
the ability to **talk to and control thousands of real-world apps** using **Zapier**.

---

## ✨ The Goal: Make Your GPT *Do* Things

Remember our dream **Travel Expense Helper GPT**? It needs to:

- Log expenses into **Google Sheets** 📊  
- Send email reports 📧

These aren’t just conversations — these are **real actions** happening in other apps!

---

## 🚧 The Big Hurdle: Too Many App Languages

If you want GPT to talk to **Google Sheets**, then **Outlook**, then **Instagram**:

- Each app has its own **computer language** (API).  
- Teaching GPT all these languages directly = **super complex** (and nearly impossible).  

It’s like teaching your AI **thousands of secret codes** one by one.

---

## ⚡ The Solution: Zapier (The Universal Translator for AI)

Zapier is **the ultimate go-between** for your GPT and thousands of apps.

**What Zapier Does:**
- Works like a **universal remote** for apps.
- Before Agentic AI, people used it for simple rules:  
  > “When I get an email, save the attachment to Dropbox.”
- Now, with GPTs:
  - GPT only needs to learn **ONE** language → **Zapier’s language**.
  - GPT tells Zapier what to do.
  - Zapier figures out how to talk to Google Sheets, Dropbox, Gmail, Slack, etc.
  - Zapier handles security and permissions for you.

## 🛠 Step-by-Step: Giving Your GPT Zapier’s Powers

### 1️⃣ Create Your Custom GPT
- Go to the **Custom GPT Builder**.
- Give it a name, e.g., `"Travel Helper"` or `"Expense Tracker"`.

---

### 2️⃣ Teach Your GPT Zapier’s “Universal Language” (API Description)
- In GPT Builder → scroll to **Actions** → click **Create new action**.
- You’ll see a screen asking for a **Schema**.
- **Good news:** Zapier already made it for you!
- Visit:  

> https://actions.zapier.com/gpt/api/v1/dynamic/openapi.json?tools=meta

- Click **Import from URL** and paste Zapier’s link.
- ✅ Your GPT just *downloaded* Zapier’s instruction manual.

---

### 3️⃣ Tell Your GPT the Specific Tasks You Want It to Do
Now that GPT knows how to speak **Zapier**, define the actions:

**Example for Travel Helper:**
- Add an action called:
> add_travel_expense

- Later, connect this to a Zapier automation that writes data into Google Sheets.

**Magic:** GPT reads your command,  
finds the right Zapier function, and calls it without you needing to code.

---

## 🎉 The Result: A GPT That *Does* Real Things

Once set up, your GPT can:

1. **Understand** your request:  
 > “Log this receipt.”
2. **Choose** the right Zapier action:  
 `add_travel_expense`
3. **Translate** it into Zapier’s language.
4. **Send** the command to Zapier.
5. Zapier updates your Google Sheet instantly.

---

## 🔑 Why This Is Powerful

- You focus on **what you want done**.  
- GPT + Zapier handle **how it gets done**.  
- Works across **thousands of apps** without learning every app’s API.

### 📌 Mini Example Flow
[You: "Log lunch expense - $15 at Joe's Diner"] <br>
↓<br>
[Custom GPT understands & calls: add_travel_expense]<br>
↓<br>
[Zapier translates and sends data to Google Sheets]<br>
↓<br>
[Expense is logged automatically ✅]<br>


### Steps taken:
1. connect custom GPT with Zapier:

2. Instruction:
```
You are going to help me catalog my travel expenses. Whenever I give you new expense, you will use add the travel expense action.

   ### Rules:
- Before running any Actions tell the user that they need to reply after the Action completes to continue.

### Instructions for Zapier AI Actions:
Step 1. Check for required action(s):
    - Call `list_available_actions` to generate available actions list
    - If required action exists → Step 4
    - If not → Step 2
Step 2. For missing required action(s):
    - Send configuration link
    - Wait for user to confirm they've configured the required action
Step 3. After user confirms configuration → proceed to Step 4 with original request
Step 4. Execute `run_action`:
    - Use the action ID from the results array of the `list_available_actions` response
    - Fill in required parameters based on user request

Required Actions:
- Action: "add_travel_expense"
```
3. Create Google Sheet
